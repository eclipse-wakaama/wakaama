Wakaama (formerly liblwm2m) is an implementation of the Open Mobile Alliance's LightWeight M2M
protocol (LWM2M).

Compiling
---------

Despite its name, liblwm2m is not a library but files to be built with an
application. liblwm2m uses CMake. Look at tests/server/CMakeLists.txt for an
example of how to include it.
Several compilation switches are used:
 - LWM2M_BIG_ENDIAN if your target platform uses big-endian format.
 - LWM2M_LITTLE_ENDIAN if your target platform uses little-endian format.
 - LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE to enable LWM2M Client interfaces.
 - LWM2M_SERVER_MODE to enable LWM2M Server interfaces.
 - LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_MODE to enable LWM2M Bootstrap Server interfaces.
 - LWM2M_BOOTSTRAP to enable LWM2M Bootstrap support in a LWM2M Client.
 - LWM2M_SUPPORT_JSON to enable JSON payload support (implicit when defining LWM2M_SERVER_MODE)
Depending on your platform, you need to define LWM2M_BIG_ENDIAN or LWM2M_LITTLE_ENDIAN.
LWM2M_CLIENT_MODE and LWM2M_SERVER_MODE can be defined at the same time.


Testing
-------

To compile the test server
 - - - - - - - - - - - - -

In the any directory, run the following commands:
    cmake [liblwm2m directory]/tests/server
    make
    ./lwm2mserver

The lwm2mserver listens on UDP port 5683. It features a basic command line
interface. Type 'help' for a list of supported commands.


To compile the test client
 - - - - - - - - - - - - -

In the any directory, run the following commands:
    cmake [liblwm2m directory]/tests/client
    make
    ./lwm2mclient [Options]

The lwm2mclient features nine LWM2M objects:
    - Security Object (id: 0)
    - Server Object (id: 1)
    - Access Control Object (id: 2) as a skeleton
    - Device Object (id: 3) containing hard-coded values from the Example LWM2M
    Client of Appendix E of the LWM2M Technical Specification.
    - Connectivity Monitoring Object (id: 2) as a skeleton
    - Firmware Update Object (id: 5) as a skeleton.
    - Location Object (id: 6) as a skeleton.
    - Connectivity Statistics Object (id: 7) as a skeleton.
    - a test object (id: 1024) with the following description:
    
                           Multiple
          Object |  ID  | Instances | Mandatoty |
           Test  | 1024 |    Yes    |    No     |
         
           Ressources:
                       Supported    Multiple
           Name | ID | Operations | Instances | Mandatory |  Type   | Range |
           test |  1 |    R/W     |    No     |    Yes    | Integer | 0-255 |
           exec |  2 |     E      |    No     |    Yes    |         |       |
           dec  |  3 |    R/W     |    No     |    Yes    |  Float  |       |
    
The lwm2mclient opens udp port 56830 and tries to register to a LWM2M Server at
127.0.0.1:5683. It features a basic command line interface. Type 'help' for a
list of supported commands.

Options are:
  -n NAME	Set the endpoint name of the Client. Default: testlwm2mclient
  -l PORT	Set the local UDP port of the Client. Default: 56830
  -h HOST	Set the hostname of the LWM2M Server to connect to. Default: localhost
  -p HOST	Set the port of the LWM2M Server to connect to. Default: 5683
  -t TIME	Set the lifetime of the Client. Default: 300
  -b		Bootstrap requested.
  -c		Change battery level over time.

To launch a bootstrap session:
./lwm2mclient -b


To compile a simpler test client
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

In the any directory, run the following commands:
    cmake [liblwm2m directory]/tests/lightclient
    make
    ./lightclient [Options]

The lightclient is much simpler that the lwm2mclient and features only four
LWM2M objects:
    - Security Object (id: 0)
    - Server Object (id: 1)
    - Device Object (id: 3) containing hard-coded values from the Example LWM2M
    Client of Appendix E of the LWM2M Technical Specification.
    - Test object (id: 1024) from the lwm2mclient as described above.

The lightclient does not feature any command-line interface.

Options are:
  -n NAME	Set the endpoint name of the Client. Default: testlightclient
  -l PORT	Set the local UDP port of the Client. Default: 56830
